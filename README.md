# Delivery Time Catcher

> Refreshes checkout pages and alerts you when delivery times are available! Works with Prime Now, InstaCart, Costco Same-Day Delivery

## Getting Started

* Just fill up your cart as you normally would and goto the checkout pages on InstaCart, Prime Now, or Costco Same-Day Delivery.
* Delivery Time Catcher refreshes the page every 10 seconds and will play a song and should send you a desktop notification if it finds something!
* You can toggle it on/off in the menu in case you still need to edit details on the checkout page.

Let me know how it goes or if you have any issues ðŸ’«
